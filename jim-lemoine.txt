Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block <div> <p> <h1> to <h6>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    every element can be represented by a box with the content inside, padding around the outsides of the content, a border around the outsides of the padding, and margin around the outside of the border.
    we can change from default content box to border box so that we can more clearly define the outer dimensions of the box and allow the insides to change as we update padding settings
